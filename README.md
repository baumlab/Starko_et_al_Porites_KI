This is the code and data for the following publication:
Starko et al. (2023). Marine heatwaves threaten cryptic coral diversity and erode associations amongst coevolving partners. Science Advances.

This repository is organised primarily into three folders
1. Data = this holds all of the data files associated with the paper
2. Analyses = this holds the scripts for each of the analyses run in the paper; the first script to run here is LoadLibraries.R 
3. dada2 = this folder holds the outputs from the dada2 analysis; due to the size of fastq files, they are not stored in the repo but are available in the SRA
